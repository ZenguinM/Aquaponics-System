---AQUAPONICS---

    BACKGROUND:     
        Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, which is able to grow both fish and plants. The main goal in an aquaponics system is to create an environment that supports both fish and plants in a symbiotic relationship. Fish waste is used as fertilizer for the plants, and the plants clean the water for the fish. This 'circular' process has benefits, such as reducing water waste, reduces waste creation, and obviously being able to grow both plants and fish in one system. Outside the immediate results of an aquaponics system, it is more economical and ecological, reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, has a much lower land footprint compared to traditional farming, better crop yield and growth, create opportunities for businesses, and many more advantages. 
    PROBLEM:        
        The Science Faculty need you to create a practical solution to a problem in Biology. For some time now, a Biology teacher has been trying to get an aquaponics system functioning properly, but they are experiencing problems maintaining the balance of pH, ammonia, nitrates and nitrites. The teacher needs a monitoring system that will alert them to variations in the concentrations of any of the variables listed above. They also require a temperature indicator.
    ADDITONAL INFO: 
        In an aquaponics system, constantly monitoring the parameters is preferred, rather than checking the values every time. The biology teacher may want this to observe any trends in their data and to be able to be alerted for any issues when they are not physically present. This can help optimize preformance and troubleshoot the aquaponics system. Adjustments to the water could be automated by running a function that connects to another program which adjusts the water quality appropriately. For example, if the water becomes dangerously hot, the water cooler will be turned on by the program. This extension is a bit hefty because the program required to run such system may require external connections. Using electronic sensors to measure the parameters may be a problem.

---PLANNING---

    PROGRAM:
        LANGUAGE:
            The program will be written in HTML, CSS, and JS, which are the three main coding languages used to program websites. 
        FUNCTION:
            The UI will have a simple design that allows for users to select a fish or a plant from the navigation bar. A description of the selected fish or plant will appear. The user can then select the parameter to be tested. The details and the input bar will appear afterwards, to which the user may input their value into the input bar and see the output displayed. The output display will change depending on if the level of the parameter is not suitable and give advice on what to do to bring the parameter to the suitable level.
        LAYOUT:
            There will be a navigation bar at the top of the screen for selection. It will have 'folder' styled tabs. A box will appear under the navigation bar which will display the information when the tab is clicked. 
        MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP):
            The MVP is a website that allows users to select the fish and the parameter, input the corresponding value and output whether the value is too high, low, or at the suitable level.

    PROCESS:
        1.  Search for fish and plants typically grown in aquaponics in Australia
        2.  Search water quality parameters and how they affect fish and plants
        3.  Search one fish for the suitable water parameters and note them
            a.  Write a seperate local file for all the data from the previous steps so it is easily accessible and changeable in the future
        4.  Create a flowchart of how the program should work
            a.  Display 'home' page
            b.  Receive input from user (button input)
            c.  Save input as variable
            d.  Display information on the water parameter
            e.  Display value input
            f.  Receive input from user (value input)
            g.  Check parameter variable and compare to data in seperate local file
            f.  Continuous update output on every input change based on value
        5.  Create a web UI with functionable buttons
            a.  Use HTML and CSS to create website
            b.  Use JS to add functionality
        6.  Add buttons for other common fish used in Australian aquaponics
            a.  Display information about the fish and related aquaponics details on user input
        7.  Adjust input to change depending on fish selected
            a.  Optimize code to account for all variables in one, rather than seperate blocks of code for each different scenario
        8.  Adjust feedback to include how to fix any issues with the water parameter (e.g. for high temperature, ensure pond is under shade)
        9.  Include button to measure all values at once
        10. Create random value simulator for the 'all parameters' which simulates what would happen if the program was connected to an external system
        11. Include a custom fish tab to allow custom values. Code for JSON file to be updated on submit.
        12. Add 'Home' tab, which activates when any button is pressed consecutively.

---WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS---

    TEMPERATURE:        
        Description:    
            Temperature is vital for bacteria and nutrient breakdown and uptake by plants and fish. Many factors can affect temperature such as climate, materials, and systems. Generally, the water temperature should ranger between 20°C - 30°C, however this differs between fish, plants, and bacteria. 
        Effect:         
            High temperatures can affect a plant's dissolved oxygen, cause wilting, and death. Cold will affect growth. Fish cannot regulate body temperatures, so knowing the category offish is vital (cold, cool, and warm water fish). Optimal temperatures help with healthgrowth, reduce stress and diseases, and feeding. High temperatures affect metabolism and oxygen requirements.
        Decreasing:     
            If the system is outside, use a shade cloth above it to reduce the impact of sunlight onthe water. This will also decrease algae growth, which may be preferred. A tank chiller can also help, but is more costly. Embedding the fish tanks underground will help with insulating the tank, but this will also depend on the temperature of the ground.
        Increasing:
            During cold months, preserving the heat of the system is vital. This can be done by insulating the tank with reflective foil or cloth. If the tanks are in a greenhouse, an air or tank heater can be used instead. Ensure tanks are suspended from the floor if it the floor gets too cold.
    
    pH:
        Description:    
            pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water. It can affect the solubilty and uptake of nutrients, microbial activity, and system stability. Factors affecting pH include fish waste, plant uptake, carbon dioxide levels, and water quality. Generally, the pH should be around 6.5 to 7.5.
        Effect:         
            Poor pH can result in stunted plant growths and poor yields, nutrient deficiency, toxicity, increased stress and diseases. Note that plants do prefer a bit more acidic water.
        Decreasing:
            Decreasing the pH is not usually required as nitrification lowers the pH naturally. If it is required however, the expensive option is reverse osmosis but it is the safest. Moving to the cheaper options, incorporating distilled water over time can help. Adding chemicals such as phosphoric or nitric acid or simply cycling the water can reduce the pH. Research must be done on the exact ratios of acid to water.
        Inceasing:
            Calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and potassium carbonate can be added to the water to increase the pH. These chemicals are also beneficial to the plants as nutrients. Be careful to add the supplements slowly to not shock the fish and to measure the effect.

    NITRATE:
        Description:
            A non-toxic form of nitrogen, which is food for the plants. The nitrogen cycle happens when ammonia from fish waste is converted to nitrites, and then into nitrates by bacterium. Generally, the absolute maximum and minimum nitrate levels should be around 3 to 150 mg/l or 150 ppm.
        Effect:
            It, as well as nitrogen, is necessary for fish and plant growth, and the cycle reduces ammonia in the system. Proper nitrates maximises crop yield. 
        Decreasing:
            Backwashing or changing the water can help to reduce nitrate leveles if needed. Implementing more plants can help increase nitrate intake by plants. Removing fish or reducing feeding amounts can also help.
        Increasing:
            Increasing nitrates can be done by adding more fish or increasing feeding amounts as fish food contains small amounts of nitrates. Adding bacteria can help, but prior research on compatibility is required.

    NITRITE:
        Description:
            Intermittent stage between the conversion between ammonia to nitrate. Nitrification is maximised at atound 25°C to 30°C. This process also reduces pH and uses oxygen. Generally, nitrites should be at 0 ppm.
        Effect:         
            Nitrite levels above 0.75 ppm can cause stress, above 5 ppm is toxic to fish. It can kill fish by affecting their oxygen intake, even if the dissolved oxygen is sufficient.
        Decreasing:
            A water change can help, along with reduced feeding rates. Removing any solids build-up and dead fish in the system will reduce nitrite. If this persists, there may not be enough bacteria for the system or there are too many fish.


    AMMONIA:
        Description:    
            Excreted by fish, ammonia is the starter for the nitrogen cycle which helps with the plants at the end. It can also come from fish food. Ammonia and pH levels are usually related; high ammonia means high pH and vice versa.
        Effect:         
            Ammonia poisoning can cause damage to fish, impair fish growth, reduce resistance to diseases, and death. Not enough ammonia will affect plant growth. Bacteria will begin to die at levels higher than 4 ppm. Ammonia tolerance varies between fish species.
        Reducing:
            Steps to reduce ammonia include: reduce feeding, remove solids accumulation through the biofilters, and water changes. Repeat periodically until the levels reach the desired amount. Be careful not to cause ammonia shock by doing small changes over time, instead of one moment.
