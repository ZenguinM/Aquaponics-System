        "Temperature": {
            "description": "Temperature is vital for bacteria and nutrient breakdown and uptake by plants and fish. Many factors can affect temperature such as climate, materials, and systems. Generally, the water temperature should ranger between 20°C - 30°C, however this differs between fish, plants, and bacteria.",
            "effect": "High temperatures can affect a plant's dissolved oxygen, cause wilting, and death. Cold will affect growth. Fish cannot regulate body temperatures, so knowing the category offish is vital (cold, cool, and warm water fish). Optimal temperatures help with healthgrowth, reduce stress and diseases, and feeding. High temperatures affect metabolism and oxygen requirements.",
            "decreasing": "If the system is outside, use a shade cloth above it to reduce the impact of sunlight onthe water. This will also decrease algae growth, which may be preferred. A tank chiller can also help, but is more costly. Embedding the fish tanks underground will help with insulating the tank, but this will also depend on the temperature of the ground.",
            "increasing": "During cold months, preserving the heat of the system is vital. This can be done by insulating the tank with reflective foil or cloth. If the tanks are in a greenhouse, an air or tank heater can be used instead. Ensure tanks are suspended from the floor if it the floor gets too cold."
        },

        "pH": {
            "description": " pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water. It can affect the solubilty and uptake of nutrients, microbial activity, and system stability. Factors affecting pH include fish waste, plant uptake, carbon dioxide levels, and water quality. Generally, the pH should be around 6.5 to 7.5.",
            "effect": "Poor pH can result in stunted plant growths and poor yields, nutrient deficiency, toxicity, increased stress and diseases. Note that plants do prefer a bit more acidic water.",
            "decreasing": "Decreasing the pH is not usually required as nitrification lowers the pH naturally. If it is required however, the expensive option is reverse osmosis but it is the safest. Moving to the cheaper options, incorporating distilled water over time can help. Adding chemicals such as phosphoric or nitric acid or simply cycling the water can reduce the pH. Research must be done on the exact ratios of acid to water.",
            "increasing": "Calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and potassium carbonate can be added to the water to increase the pH. These chemicals are also beneficial to the plants as nutrients. Be careful to add the supplements slowly to not shock the fish and to measure the effect."
        },

        "Nitrate": {
            "description": "A non-toxic form of nitrogen, which is food for the plants. The nitrogen cycle happens when ammonia from fish waste is converted to nitrites, and then into nitrates by bacterium. Generally, the nitrate level should be around 3 to 150 mg/L or ppm, both units are equal in measurement.",
            "effect": "It, as well as nitrogen, is necessary for fish and plant growth, and the cycle reduces ammonia in the system. Proper nitrates maximises crop yield.",
            "decreasing": "Backwashing or changing the water can help to reduce nitrate leveles if needed. Implementing more plants can help increase nitrate intake by plants. Removing fish or reducing feeding amounts can also help.",
            "increasing": "Increasing nitrates can be done by adding more fish or increasing feeding amounts as fish food contains small amounts of nitrates. Adding bacteria can help, but prior research on compatibility is required."
        },

        "Nitrite": {
            "description": "Intermittent stage between the conversion between ammonia to nitrate. Nitrification is maximised at atound 25°C to 30°C. This process also reduces pH and uses oxygen. Generally, nitrites should be at 0 ppm.",
            "effect": "Nitrite levels above 0.75 ppm can cause stress, above 5 ppm is toxic to fish. It can kill fish by affecting their oxygen intake, even if the dissolved oxygen is sufficient.",
            "decreasing": "A water change can help, along with reduced feeding rates. Removing any solids build-up and dead fish in the system will reduce nitrite. If this persists, there may not be enough bacteria for the system or there are too many fish.",
            "increasing": "Your nitrite levels should not be under 0. Please ensure that you have not placed a negative sign in the input."
        },

        "Ammonia": {
            "description": "Excreted by fish, ammonia is the starter for the nitrogen cycle which helps with the plants at the end. It can also come from fish food. Ammonia and pH levels are usually related; high ammonia means high pH and vice versa. High oxygen levels help remove ammonia.",
            "effect": "Ammonia poisoning can cause damage to fish, impair fish growth, reduce resistance to diseases, and death. Not enough ammonia will affect plant growth. Bacteria will begin to die at levels higher than 4 ppm. Ammonia tolerance varies between fish species but in most fish, keeping it near 0 is the preferred amount.",
            "decreasing": "Steps to reduce ammonia include: reduce feeding, remove solids accumulation through the biofilters, and water changes. Repeat periodically until the levels reach the desired amount. Be careful not to cause ammonia shock by doing small changes over time, instead of one moment.",
            "increasing": "Your ammonia levels should not be under 0. Please ensure that you have not placed a negative sign in the input."
