---AQUAPONICS---
Background:     Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, which is able to grow both fish and plants
Water quality:  The parameters assessed in this code will be the nitrite, nitrate, pH, temperature, and ammonia

---PLANTS---
    GENERAL:
        Temperature:    18째C - 80째C
        pH:             6.0 - 7.0
        Nitrate:        5 - 150 ppm
        Nitrite:        0 ppm
        Ammonia:        0 ppm

---FISH---
    GOLDFISH:
        Description:    A freshwater fish, typically kept as an indoor pet. They are hardy and come in a variety of shapes and colours.
        Temperature:    21째C - 24째C
        pH:             7.0 - 7.5
        Nitrate:        < 50 ppm (lower may be better)
        Nitrite:        < 0.2 ppm
        Ammonia:        < 0.02 ppm
